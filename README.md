SVL - Scalable Vector Logo
==========================

Logo turtle geometry language implementation in JS+SVG.

For now:
- **[DiPoHLo](https://goo.gl/fZBLJt) - Distribuição Portável do HotLogo** (HotLogo Portable Distribution).
- two e-books about HotLogo: **[Figstar](https://goo.gl/9lypp1)**, written between 1991 and 1992; and **[Logo Tecnic](https://goo.gl/Q4NBLl)**, written between 1992 and 1994. Both almost ready, but never finalized :-p
- my [Web Interface](https://goo.gl/JVIjom) in construction for [jMSX](http://www.hwado.net/javamsx/).
- [logodump](https://goo.gl/cNPXiw), a procedure in HotLogo to dump its own code from the cartridge for creation of a ROM image file with some further tweaks in BASh and Perl. Created in 1999/08/23.
- some [SVL test outputs](https://goo.gl/R7gsWx) (lists, recursion, multiple turtles, 3D), saved in svg files.

And:
- some [screen recordings](https://goo.gl/kGfiWc) in YouTube of HotLogo projects made between 1988 and 1991, running mainly in [openMSX](http://openmsx.org/).
