SVL - Scalable Vector Logo
==========================

Logo Turtle Geometry language implementation in JS+SVG.

For now:
- **[DiPoHLo](https://goo.gl/fZBLJt) - Distribuição Portável do HotLogo** (HotLogo Portable Distribution)
- two e-books about HotLogo: [Figstar](https://goo.gl/9lypp1), written between 1991 and 1992; and [Logo Tecnic](https://goo.gl/Q4NBLl), written between 1992 and 1994. Both unfinished.
- my [Web Interface](https://goo.gl/JVIjom) in construction for [jMSX](http://www.hwado.net/javamsx/)
- [logodump](https://goo.gl/cNPXiw), a procedure in HotLogo to dump its own cartridge in files for creation of a hotlogo rom after some further tweaks in BASh and Perl 
- some .svl [tests](https://goo.gl/R7gsWx) saved in .svg files

And:
- some [screen recordings](https://goo.gl/kGfiWc) in YouTube of HotLogo projects made between 1988 and 1991, running mainly in [openMSX](http://openmsx.org/)
